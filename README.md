# Flutter-Learning

I learn Flutter to create Android and IOS applications.

To learn this SDK I use the [codelabs](https://flutter.dev/docs/codelabs) on the official website of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

I also learned the basics of the Dart language with this [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/from-java-to-dart/#0) and the official website of [Dart](https://dart.dev/)


## Organization

Each folder is a Flutter application created with the help of a codelab.

In each of these folders you will find a README.md with the link to the codelab used to create the application.
